# üå± Talking Plant Using ESP32

A smart IoT-based system that gives your plant a ‚Äúvoice‚Äù by monitoring environmental conditions and playing real-time voice alerts through a speaker.

## üìå Project Overview

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller along with various sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light) to monitor a plant's health. When a threshold is crossed, the system plays a relevant pre-recorded MP3 message using the DFPlayer Mini, making plant care more interactive and educational.

## üéØ Objective

To create an interactive plant care assistant that uses real-time sensor inputs and audio messages to notify users about plant needs like water or sunlight.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

- Sensors send environmental data to the ESP32.
- Based on the readings, the ESP32 triggers the DFPlayer Mini to play relevant voice clips.
- These clips alert users with messages like **"Water me!"** or **"I need sunlight!"**

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build

1. Connect all sensors and DFPlayer to the ESP32 on a breadboard.
2. Store voice messages as `.mp3` files on a microSD card.
3. Upload the Arduino sketch to the ESP32.
4. Power the device and test the sensor-triggered audio alerts.

## ‚úÖ Results

- Accurately detects soil, temperature, humidity, and light levels.
- Plays the correct voice messages when thresholds are met.
- Engaging and fun way to learn IoT and embedded systems.

## ‚≠ê Features

- No display required (cost-efficient)
- Interactive and beginner-friendly
- Great educational project for IoT learning

## üö´ Limitations

- No remote or mobile monitoring
- Requires pre-recorded MP3 messages
- Best suited for controlled environments

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
